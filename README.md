# Pathfinding and Search Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various pathfinding and search algorithms in Python. The algorithms included are:  
## 1. A* Search: Finds the shortest path on a 5x5 grid using the Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
## 2. Open Lock: Solves the lock problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
## 3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Finds the shortest path in a weighted, directed graph.
## 4. Shortest Bridge: Connects two islands in a binary matrix with the minimum number of flips using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
