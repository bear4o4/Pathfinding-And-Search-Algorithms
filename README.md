Pathfinding and Search Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various pathfinding and search algorithms in Python. The algorithms included are:  
A* Search: Finds the shortest path on a 5x5 grid using the Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
Open Lock: Solves the lock problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Finds the shortest path in a weighted, directed graph.
Shortest Bridge: Connects two islands in a binary matrix with the minimum number of flips using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
